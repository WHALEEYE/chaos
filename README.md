# CHAOS

This repo is the source code CHAOS, my personal blog.

CHAOS is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped
with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), and later developed
with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Create Your Own

This repo is set as a template (it may need some refactor in the future to be simpler to use though). If you want to use
it to create your own blog, just [use template](https://github.com/WHALEEYE/chaos/generate) to generate your own repo.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the files. The page will auto-updates as you edit.
